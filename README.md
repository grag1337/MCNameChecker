# MCNameChecker
Most useful late night project so far.

This just automatically requests names from namemc.com and returns back if they're available or not.
I don't have the effort to import proxies to avoid getting the too many requests exception, so i'm just waiting 60 seconds to bypass that instead.
If someone wants to do that for me I will love them forever.
