# MCNameChecker
Most useful late night project so far.

This just automatically requests names from namemc.com and returns back if they're available or not.
I don't have the effort to import proxies to avoid getting the too many requests exception, so i'm just waiting 60 seconds to bypass that instead.
If someone wants to do that for me I will love them forever.

# Installation

**Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/grag1337/MCNameChecker
```

**Install the requirements // Optionally you can leave this step and just install the ones that python throws at you when you try to launch it, because the requirements here are all of the ones installed on my computer, not just the ones that are required for the project.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Create a words.txt file wherever you have installed the python script and fill it with a word per line.

**Run the fucker
```
python check.py
```

**ENJOY!

If there are any issues let me know so I can try to fix whatever shitty code I have written.
